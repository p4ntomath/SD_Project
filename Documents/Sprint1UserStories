# SPRINT ONE USER STORIES AND USER ACCEPTANCE TESTS

 User Stories

1. As a researcher, I can log in to the system so that I can access and manage my projects.
2. As a reviewer, I can log in to the system so that I can view and review my assigned projects.
3. As a user, I can reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget my password.
4. As a researcher, I can create a new research project so that I can work on it and collaborate with others easily.

 User Acceptance Tests
The following User Acceptance Tests are written and numbered using the identifiers of the 4 User Stories that have been named above for this sprint:

1. Given I am a researcher with valid login credentials, when I enter my login credentials then I should be redirected to my dashboard where I can view and manage my projects.

2. Given I am a reviewer with valid login credentials, when I enter my login credentials then I should be redirected to my dashboard where I can review and manage my assigned projects.
3. Given I am a user with an existing account associated with my email address, when I enter my registered email address on the “Forgot Password” page, then I should receive an email with a link to reset my password.
4. Given I am a researcher, and I have logged in on the system, when I navigate to the “Create new project" page and fill out the required information then I should be able to successfully create the project and see it listed on my dashboard.
