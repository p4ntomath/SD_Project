## 2. User Acceptance Tests

The following User Acceptance Tests are written and numbered using the identifiers of the 6 User Stories that have been named above for this sprint:

1.	Given I am a researcher with projects, when I open a project that I would like to be reviewed, then I should be able to send a request to a reviewer asking them to review my selected project.  
2.	Given I am a reviewer, when I receive a request from a researcher asking me to review their project, then I should be able to either accept that request or decline it. 
3.	Given I am a researcher, when I open a project and upload a file on it, then that file should appear under “Uploaded Documents” so that it can be downloaded by collaborators or reviewers who are part of the project. 
4.	Given I am a reviewer, when I receive a request to review a project, then I should be able to see the details of that project. 
5.	Given I am a reviewer, when I open a project that I have agreed to review, then I should be able to download and view a file that has been uploaded on that project. 
6.	Given I am an administrator, when I click on the “Total Users” tab, then I should be able to see all the users who have signed up on the platform.
