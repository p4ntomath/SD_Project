| 1          | As a researcher, I can add milestones (Project goals) to a project so that I can easily track key goals for the project.                                                | 10   |
| 2          | As a researcher, I can add funding to my projects so that I can track how I use the money.                                                                         | 10   |
| 3          | As a researcher, I can see an overview of the funding received and its breakdown by projects so that I can view the amount I spent on each project.            | 8    |
| 4          | As a researcher, I can tick the milestones (Goals) I have achieved on a project so that I can track my progress.                                                     | 6    |
| 5          | As a researcher, I can receive suggestions for funding opportunities so that I can see details of available funding.                                                 | 10   |
| 6          | As a researcher, I can update the project details of a project that is in progress so that I can ensure that they are up to date with any changes to the project. | 8    |

## 2. User Acceptance Tests

The following User Acceptance Tests are written and numbered using the identifiers of the 6 User Stories that have been named above for this sprint:

1.	Given I am a researcher, and I am creating/updating a project, when I enter my project goals then the goals should appear in the project goals list.
2.	Given I am a researcher, when I add funding to my project then that funding should appear under Funding Details so that I can be able to track where that funding has been used.
3.	Given I am a researcher who has received funding before, when I open the track funding page, then I should be able to see the funds that I currently have and a breakdown by project name and amounts on each project. 
4.	Given I am a researcher, and I have a project with milestones (Goals), when I click the checkbox next to a milestone, then the status bar under Overall Progress should display the amount of work I have done on the project.
5.	Given I am a researcher and I have a project, when I navigate to the “Track Funding” page, then the system should display funding opportunities that are available. 
6.	Given I am a researcher, when I update the project details of one of my projects, those details should be updated on the database, and they should be displayed on the project page.
